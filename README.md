Practice on how to create a blog website in HTML & CSS

This just a fake-ish blog. I was trying to make a blog website from scratch using HTML & CSS to practice the programming languages.

While the webpages are topics/projects I'm interested in, I only ever actually made progress in the "Comics" section, so that'll be the 
only place you can see anything that kinda looks like a functioning blog. To get there start by opening "homepage.html." Next click on 
the "Art" link to get to the art projects sub-homepage. Then scroll down to the "Digital Snapshot" section and click the last torch in the row.
This should get you to some post about me trying to turn a book a read into a comic.
