			<h2>Digital Snapshot</h2>
			<p>Add a section here to show the "Digital Art" page. This display is a literal snapshot (image) that should take the visitor to the webpage when clicked.</p>
			<p>I would like "Digital Snapshot" to be a colage of random digital arts I've made.</p>

		<!-- traditional snapshot -->
		<div>
			<h2>Traditional Snapshot</h2>
			<p>I would like the "Traditional Snaphot" to be one picture of a drawing I've made.</p>
			<p>The snapshots as a whole should also look like a collage. When the visitor hovers their mouse over one, that one should "pop up" slightly and it's borders should bolden and change color. It would help to if the other snapshots desaturated and shrunk a little too.</p>
		</div>
		
		<!-- carving snapshot -->
		<div>
			<h2>Carving Snapshot</h2>
			<p>This snapshot should just be of my desk with a peice of carved wood, my carving knife, and some woodshavings.</p>
		</div>
		
		<!-- comics snapshot -->
		<div>
			<h2>Comics Snapshot</h2>
			<p>This can either be of one of the covers of the comics I made, or a collage of parts of the pages of those comics.</p>
