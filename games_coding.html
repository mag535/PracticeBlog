			<p class="codepost">This is the first game I made for <a href="https://gameheadsoakland.org">Gameheads'</a> Summer Acceleration Program. It's like a summer-long game jam. After having some classes on some basic game design stuff, we have a small "March Madness" project, then form teams for the summer.</p>
			<p class="codepost">I made the mistake of being a Project Manager and Programmer... but in the end my team managed to create a game in three weeks and it's pretty okay!</p>
			<p class="codepost">This project is actually from last summer (2021), but I wasn't working on this then, so I forgot.</p>
